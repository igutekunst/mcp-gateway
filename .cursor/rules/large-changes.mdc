For large changes:
- See README.md
- first examine full codebase for context
- Suggest updating README if it doesn't match codebase.
- Suggest possible large changes
- Assess if architecture and best practices are being followd. If not, ask if I'd like to make changes.
- Break changes into sections. Ask me for confirmation before doing anything.
- Document changes in a file docs/dev-journal/good-name-for-change.md in detail with multiple steps
- Do one step at a time, and run any relevant unit tests. Ask me if it looks good, then update readme, commit and push
